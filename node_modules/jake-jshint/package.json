It should also work for [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/). \n\nYou're welcome to use the runner for your own projects. (See license below.) This project was just a quick hack, so I can't vouch for its robustness, but it should work in most cases. One flaw I'm aware of is that it assumes all files are UTF8-encoded, which may not be true for your system. It also has no exception handling.\n\nThe runner is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) module. It exposes three functions:\n\n      validateSource(sourceCode, [options], [globals], [description])\n   \nRun JSHint on raw source code and output the results to the console (using `console.log()`). If the code failed to validate, the details are also output to the console. If the code succeeded, a one-line `ok` message is displayed. If provided, `description` will be prepended to the pass/fail message, like this: `description ok`.\n\nThis function returns `true` if the code was valid or `false` if errors were found. `options` and `globals` are passed through to JSHint.\n\n      validateFile(filename, [options], [globals])\n   \nSame as `validateSource`, except that the source code is read from a file.\n\n      validateFileList(fileList, [options], [globals])\n  \nValidates multiple files and outputs the results for each one. All files are validated even when some fail.\n\n`fileList` is expected to be an array. This function returns `true` if *all* files are valid and `false` otherwise.\n\n## Installing with [NPM](http://npmjs.org/)\n\nInstall with:\n\n    npm install jake-jshint\n\nOr you may also install it as a development dependency in a package.json file:\n\n    // package.json\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n      \"jake-jshint\": \"latest\"\n    }\n\nThen install it with `npm install`\n\n## Running Tests\n\nfirst:\n     \n     $ npm install -d\nthen:\n     \n     $ ./jake.sh\n\n## Super simple to use\n\nJake JsHint is designed to be the simplest way to lint your project from a jake script.\n\n```javascript\ndesc(\"Lint the code\");\ntask(\"lint\", [], function() {\n  var files = new jake.FileList();\n  files.include(\"lib/*.js\");\n  files.include(\"test/*.js\");\n  files.include(\"build/*.js\");\n  files.include(\"./*.js\");\n  files.exclude(\"node_modules\");\n  \n  var options = {\n    node: true\n  };\n\n  var globals = {\n    describe: false\n  };\n\n  var pass = lint.run(files.toArray(), options, globals);\n  if (!pass) fail(\"Lint failed\");\n});\n```\nFor a full list of JsHint options check [here](http://www.jshint.com/docs/). \n\nHere is a suggested set:\n\n```javascript\nvar options = {\n    bitwise: true,\n    curly: false,\n    eqeqeq: true,\n    forin: true,\n    immed: true,\n    latedef: true,\n    newcap: true,\n    noarg: true,\n    noempty: true,\n    nonew: true,\n    regexp: true,\n    undef: true,\n    strict: true,\n    trailing: true,\n    node: true\n  };\n\n  var globals = {\n    describe: false,\n    it: false,\n    beforeEach: false,\n    afterEach: false\n  };\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2012 James Shore\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
